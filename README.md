# Nodejs/Express Timestamp Microservice

### Installation
To run the project, simply clone the package and run the commands bellow in the root folder of the cloned project. The application will then be started and can be accessed via the localhost:3000 or 127.0.0.1:3000 route inside your browser.
```sh
$ npm i
$ node index.js
```

### Live version
a live version of the application is available at https://guttural-supermarket.glitch.me/.

### Objectives
1. Objective: Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://timestamp-ms.herokuapp.com/ and deploy it to Glitch.
2. Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Glitch project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit https://freecodecamp.org/challenges/get-set-for-our-api-development-projects.
3. Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:
4. User Story: I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).
5. User Story: If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.
6. User Story: If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.
7. Once you've finished implementing these user stories, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and enter the URLs for both your GitHub repository and your live app running on Glitch.
8. You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.
